Application Examples
====================

Here, you will find a variety of tutorials, examples and networks. 
Before proceeding, ensure that the SIR 3S Toolkit is properly installed (see :ref:`Installation instructions <installing-toolkit-label>`). 

The tutorials are designed to help new users to get started with the basic functionalities of the SIR 3S Toolkit.
The application examples build on that foundation and demonstrate how the SIR 3S Toolkit can be used in real-world scenarios.
The included networks illustrate typical topologies of SIR 3S models.

Examples
--------

These examples are intended for users who are already familiar with the basic functionality of the SIR 3S Toolkit and demonstrate how to apply it to real-world scenarios.

Each example is available for both **viewing** and **downloading** as an `.ipynb` file. 

.. _Tex1:

Example 1: Shape Import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Example demonstrates how to create a connected topological network of nodes and pipes in SIR 3S via teh SIR 3S Toolkit based on shapefile data. The data used comes from 'SIR 3S\Modelle\Beispiele\Wasser\Manual\Projektdaten\01 Shape-Dateien'.
