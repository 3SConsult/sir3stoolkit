**SIR 3S Toolkit**

**SIR 3S Toolkit** is a Python package developed by 3S Consult that provides full programmatic control over SIR 3S models. At its core, the package wraps C# functionality, offering low-level access through methods like SetValue(), GetValue(), AddNewNode(), and more.

Built on top of this core subpackage are additional subpackages that offer higher-level abstractions, enabling more powerful and intuitive interactions with SIR 3S models. This layered design ensures flexibility and makes the Toolkit easily extensible for future enhancements.
