Getting Started
===============

This guide is your first step towards understanding and utilizing the SIR 3S Toolkit.

.. note::
    In order to use the SIR 3S Toolkit, access to SIR 3S models and a licensed SIR 3S version are necessary.

What is SIR 3S Toolkit?
-----------------------

**SIR 3S Toolkit** is a Python package that provides a programming interface for SIR 3S - 
a software for the simulation, analysis and optimization of flow processes in gas/water/heat supply networks, 
plants, pipelines and caverns.

While SIR 3S itself is a graphical user interface (GUI)-based application that is primarily operated through manual user input, 
the SIR 3S Toolkit adds a powerful layer of automation and programmability. It enables users to interact with SIR 3S models through 
Python code, making it possible to develop custom workflows, perform batch simulations, and integrate SIR 3S into larger analytical 
or operational pipelines.

At its core, the package wraps basic functionality of SIR 3S, offering a low-level access to the creation, modification and simulation of SIR 3S models. 
Several method operations of the kind Get, Set, Add, Delete, Insert and many more are provided for this aim.
This gives you a variety of opportunities, e.g.:

* You can build models solely from scratch, defining nodes, pipes, and more, flexibly adapted 
to your available data sources, thus extending SIR 3S's built-in import tools.

* The analysis of model data and simulation results can leverage the entire Python data science 
ecosystem, enabling powerful insights using tools like pandas, NumPy, and others.

On top of this core, higher-level functionality is provided, enabling more powerful and intuitive interactions with SIR 3S models. 

What is the difference between SIR 3S Toolkit and PT3S?
-------------------------------------------------------

Since SIR 3S already offers `PT3S <https://github.com/3SConsult/PT3S>`_ as a Python package for accessing model data, you might wonder: why use the SIR 3S Toolkit if you're already working with PT3S?

PT3S provides powerful access to a model's database and calculation results by reading .mx and .db3 files via SQL directly. However, it operates from the outside â€” offering read-only access to exposed data structures. What it doesn't offer is a straightforward way to create, modify, or interact with core SIR 3S objects like nodes, pipes, and more.

That's where the SIR 3S Toolkit comes in. It goes beyond file access and interacts directly with the internal structure of a SIR 3S model, enabling full programmatic control over model creation, editing, and analysis.
 
If you want to make full use of Python's capabilities for working with your SIR 3S model, 
it is currently recommended to use both packages. In the future it is possible 
that the PT3S functionalities will be integrated into the SIR 3S Toolkit.

Installation
------------

To install the SIR 3S Toolkit, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain SIR 3S:** The SIR 3S Toolkit requires an installed SIR 3S version of 90-15 Quebec or higher, which includes the ``Sir3S_Toolkit.dll``

2. **Install the SIR 3S Toolkit via pip in SIR 3S Environment:** Open a cmd and enter the following commands to install the SIR 3S Toolkit in the Python environment in the ``Common`` folder of your SIR 3S installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd "C:/3S/SIR 3S Entwicklung/Common/Python312" #change to your local path
       python.exe -m pip install sir3stoolkit


3. **Optional: Install the SIR 3S Toolkit via pip in another Python environment:** Open a cmd in the desired Python environment (e.g. Anaconda Python installation) and enter the following commands to install the SIR 3S Toolkit:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install sir3stoolkit
       
If you encounter issues with that, located the python.exe file of the environment and follow step 1.

We now invite you to visit the :doc:`examples` page to understand basic Toolkit functionalities.
