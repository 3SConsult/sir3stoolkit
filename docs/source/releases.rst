Releases
========

In general the SIR 3S Toolkit will first be released with the SIR 3S version 90-15 Quebec with the Toolkit version 90.15.0.1.dev1. Between the release of Quebec and the next major SIR 3S release, the Toolkit will receive updates. 
This can either be a pure python update that can be obtained using ``pip install --upgrade sir3stoolkit`` or it can include changes in the C# code wrapped by the core subpackage. In this case before upgrading via pip the ``Sir3S_Toolkit.dll`` in the SIR Graf directory has to be exchanged. The release notes indicate what kind of release it is. How the dll will be published is still to be determined.
