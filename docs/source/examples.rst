Application Examples
====================

Welcome to the page dedicated to application examples of SIR 3S Toolkit! Here, you will find a variety of tutorials, examples and networks. You need to already have Toolkit installed (:ref:`Install instructions <installing-toolkit-label>`). 

Tutorials are meant to introduce new Toolkit users to its basic functionalities. Examples introduce Toolkit users who understand its basic functionality to real-world application Examples. The networks are examples of SIR 3S model topologies.

.. note:: The Data necessary for running the notebooks has not been included yet.

Tutorials
---------

These Tutorials are meant to introduce new Toolkit users to its basic functionalities. They built on each other, so if you want a very quick overview on how Toolkit works, just view the last Tutorial.

Each tutorial is available for both **viewing** and **downloading** as an `.ipynb` file. 

.. _Ttu1:

Tutorial 1: Importing and Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Tutorial demonstrates how to import the Toolkit and intialize instances of its classes.

You can view the Notebook `here <tutorials/ToolkitTutorial1.html>`_.

You can download the Notebook file :download:`here <tutorials/ToolkitTutorial1.ipynb>`.

.. _Ttu2:

Tutorial 2: Creating or Opening a SIR 3S Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Tutorial demonstrates how to create new SIR 3S Models or open already existing ones.

You can view the Notebook `here <tutorials/ToolkitTutorial2.html>`_.

You can download the Notebook file :download:`here <tutorials/ToolkitTutorial2.ipynb>`.

You can download the data necessary to run the Tutorial locally:

.. toggle::

   - `Download Tutorial_2_OpenModel.db3 <https://github.com/3SConsult/sir3stoolkit/releases/download/tutorial_assets/Toolkit_Tutorial2_OpenModel.db3>`_


.. _TtuX:

Tutorial X: Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial does not demonstrate use cases of SIR 3S Toolkit, but serves as a template for contributors, who want to create their own Example.

You can view the Notebook `here <tutorials/ToolkitTutorialX.html>`_.

You can download the Notebook file :download:`here <tutorials/ToolkitTutorialX.ipynb>`.

Examples
--------

Examples introduce Toolkit users who understand its basic functionality to real-world application Examples.

Each example is available for both **viewing** and **downloading** as an `.ipynb` file. 

.. _Tex1:

Example 1: Shapeimport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Example demonstrates how to create a connected topological network of nodes and pipes in SIR 3S via Toolkit based on shp data. The data used comes from 'SIR 3S\Modelle\Beispiele\Wasser\Manual\Projektdaten\01 Shape-Dateien'.

You can view the Notebook `here <examples/Toolkit_Example1.html>`_.

You can download the Notebook file :download:`here <examples/Toolkit_Example1.ipynb>`.

.. _TexX:

Example X: Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example does not demonstrate use cases of SIR 3S Toolkit, but serves as a template for contributors, who want to create their own Example.

Networks
--------

The networks are examples of SIR 3S model topologies.

Each network is available for both **viewing** and **downloading** as an `.py` file. You can open and run it via the Python Console in SIR Graf.

.. _Tnw1:

Network 1
