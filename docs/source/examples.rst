Application Examples
====================

Here, you will find a variety of tutorials, examples and networks. 
Make sure you have the SIR 3S Toolkit installed before continuing (:ref:`Installation instructions <installing-toolkit-label>`). 

The tutorials are designed to help new users get started with the basic functionalities of the SIR 3S Toolkit.
The application examples build on that foundation and demonstrate how the toolkit can be used in real-world scenarios.
The included networks illustrate typical topologies of SIR 3S models.

.. note:: The data required to run the notebooks is not included yet.

Tutorials
---------

These tutorials are designed to introduce new users to the basic functionalities of the SIR 3S Toolkit. 
They build on each other, so if you want a very quick overview on how SIR 3S Toolkit works, 
just view the last tutorial.

Each tutorial is available for **viewing** as an `.ipynb` file and for **downloading** as a `.zip` archive, 
which also includes all necessary data files.

You can also download all tutorials and their respective data in a joint `.zip` archive at once `here <https://github.com/3SConsult/sir3stoolkit/releases/download/tutorial_assets/Tutorial1-X_Assets.zip>`_.

Examples
--------

These examples are intended for users who are already familiar with the basic functionality of the Toolkit and demonstrate how to apply it to real-world scenarios.

Each example is available for both **viewing** and **downloading** as an `.ipynb` file. 

.. _Tex1:

Example 1: Shape Import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Example demonstrates how to create a connected topological network of nodes and pipes in SIR 3S via Toolkit based on shapefile data. The data used comes from 'SIR 3S\Modelle\Beispiele\Wasser\Manual\Projektdaten\01 Shape-Dateien'.

Networks
--------

The networks are examples of SIR 3S model topologies.

Each network is available for both **viewing** and **downloading** as an `.py` file. You can open and run it using the Python Console in SIR Graf.
